# Frontend

Bot Protection extension checks all visitors of your store - whether they robots
or not.

If you read about backend settings of this extension, then you probably know
visitors are separated into three lists:

- whitelist
- blacklist
- suspicious list.

Blacklisted visitor sees 'access denied' page when he come to your store.

Visitor from suspicious list who has to solve captcha sees 'confirm human' page.

You can modify this pages or create new if you want. Please, read how to do it
on [Bot Protection Configuration](../backend/extension-configuration/#response-page)
page.

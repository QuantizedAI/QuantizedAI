![Scroll Depth at GA](/images/m1/extensions/ga-plugin-events/cover.png)

1. [Installation](installation/)
2. [Extension Configuration](extension-configuration/)

This extension offers functionality to track different events in your store.
Events are customer interactions with content that can be tracked independently from a web page load. This plugin lets you collect data about **add to cart, add to compare list, view cart, go to checkout** and few other events.

To check what events your store sends to Google Analytics, you can use [Google Tag Assistant](https://get.google.com/tagassistant/).

**Notice:** Additional Events extension works correctly if you already setup
[Google Api settings](http://docs.magento.com/m1/ce/user_guide/configuration/sales/google-api.html?Highlight=Analytics) in Magento backend. Otherwise no
events will be sent.

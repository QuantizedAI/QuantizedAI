# Installation

Please follow next steps to complete the installation:

1. Go to store backend and disable compilation mode.
2. Go to your magento store root directory (via FTP or CPanel).
3. Create file `maintenance.flag` in root directory.
4. Open your store in browser; you have to see page
`Service Temporarily Unavailable` (if you can not see this page - probably you
try to install extension at wrong magento instance).
5. Unpack all files from extension archive into your magento store root directory.
6. Remove file `maintenance.flag` when copy process completed.
7. Logout from your Magento Admin and login again.
8. Start to configure extension.

If you can not find Google Analytics Additional Events extension in store
admin, check cache management and refresh cache if it is enabled. Not done
yet? Check the store compilation and run recompilation if it is enabled.

# Helpmate

Helpmate consists of 2 tightly integrated modules:

**Help Desk** extension helps a dedicated support team to provide prompt support to store users.

**Knowledge Base** provides a categorised directory for frequently asked questions and answers.

Helpmate extension was created in order to allow you:

* to accept issues via e-mail, contact form or customer account page 24 hours per day & 7 days per week
* to help focus your support team on really important issues while ignoring inactive tickets

![New ticket interface](/images/m1/extensions/helpmate/add-new-ticket.png)

* to set up a [proper time zone](configuration/#time-configuration) in order to make a support process user-friendly
* to [create knowledge articles](managing-a-knowledgebase/#creating-new-articles) based on already solved clients issues, which will allow your customers to help themselves without bothering your support team

Please review the following basic terms before using the extension.

`Support department` - allows to group your support team on separate departments in order to increase support efficiency.

`Admin Users` - specially designated staff which is responsible for answering requests. Each admin can participate in various support departments.

`Email Gateway` - divides emails with access via either pop3 or imap protocol. The feature allows to establish 2-way communication from user to specific support departments.

`Ticket` - is a separate issue posed by the customer and assigned to specific department. Ticket can be created via contact form, helpmate form, backend or via email.

`Notification email` - is an email which provides the notification about ticket updating both for admin and user.

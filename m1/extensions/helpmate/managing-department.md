# Managing department

The following settings allow you to distribute different types of requests between various groups of support administrators. The use of different departments saves time and makes the support process more efficient. In order to use our extension, you have to create at least one active department.

Also you can create multiple departments and direct support tickets to them. In order to create a new department go `Admin > Templates Master > Helpmate > Department` and click on **Add Department**.

**General tab**

-   In the `Text` field specify the department Name.
-   In the `Store View` select the store where the department will be active. This setting allows you to assign support department to separate store.
-   In the `Create date` field select the date of the department creation from a calendar.

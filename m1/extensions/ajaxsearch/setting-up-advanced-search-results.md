# Setting up advanced search results

![Improved search box](/images/m1/extensions/ajax-search/advanced-search.png)

-   `Use the default Magento search` - select **No** to enable the advanced search by SKU, color, price, etc. You have to mark values in a list only. In case you choose **Yes**, the search results in Ajax Search and Autocomplete search box will be similiar with the results on Magento search page.

-   `Use custom collection on search controller` - we recommend to select **No**. However if you are not satisfied with search results, you can try using a custom collection.

# Checkout feature

There are two critical situations that can happen while customer places order:

- deal ends before customer clicks **`Place order`** on checkout;
- store owner changes the amount of deal before customer clicks
**`Place order`** on checkout.

Customer can have bad expirience with your store in such cases. Customer saw
order amount in summary on checkout, but this amount is different in final order.

Our extension protects your customers from such unpleasant experience
with your store. Extension redirects customer to shopping cart with a message
about any mismatches during placing order with daily deals.

This verification supports standard Magento Onepage and Multishipping Checkout
and [FireCheckout](/m1/extensions/firecheckout/) from Templates Master. If you
have other checkout extension it would also be provided with verification
feature. All you need is to contact our support team.

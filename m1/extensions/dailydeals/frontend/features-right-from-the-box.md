# Features right from the box

Look at what you get on frontend after you create deal. Screenshots are taken from
RWD theme:

##### Product page with deal timer

##### Product listing page with deal timers

You can turn it off in [extension settings](../../backend/extension-configuration/).

##### All products with active deals in one place

If you created deal but there are still no products on page ***'Deals today'***,
please check the root category it should have option `Is anchored` set to `Yes`.

##### Add to cart product with deal

If customer adds to a cart the product with deal and deal ends less than in 10
minutes, then he see the message in shopping cart next to product:

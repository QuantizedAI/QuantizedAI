# Other products with discount on deals page

With our extension you will encourage customers to buy not only products included
in deal, but also products that have any discount in your store. In order to
show other products with discount, enable the option `Add other
products with discount to list` in
[extension configuration](../../../backend/extension-configuration/).

Your deals page will look like this after setting that option. Please note,
*deals products are always first*.

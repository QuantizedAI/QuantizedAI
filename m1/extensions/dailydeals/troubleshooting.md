# Troubleshooting

### Deals page does not show all items or is empty

Please, check root category of your store. Root category has to be anchored
(check image below). Then deals page will show all offers as it is [here](../frontend/features-right-from-the-box/#all-products-with-active-deals-in-one-place).

After changing root category you may need to flush magento cache and reindex
`Category Products`.

# Daily Deals

Daily deal is actually an ecommerce business model when a website
offers a single product for sale for a period of 24 to 36 hours.

Our extension allows you create deals which last one, two, three or more days.
You can even make a deal will be active for a few weeks and will include more
than one product. With our extension you could create periodic deals. For example,
periodic Weekend deal or periodic Friday night deal.

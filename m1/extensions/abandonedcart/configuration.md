### Email

Basically there are 2 ways of sending reminders: through the cron and after approving the email by administrator. Use Email settings to set up the correct sending of reminders.

-   `Transport` - select **Yes** to transmit messages from sender to recipient.
-   `Queue` - specify a queue value when a delivery should start.

### Rule information

Before sending a reminder you have to specify the information in **Rule** fields. Generally you can send reminders to specific customer groups and to various stores. Youâ€™re allowed to update a product price, add a discount, set the time range, etc.

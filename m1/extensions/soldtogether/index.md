# Sold Together

The module is based on cross-selling strategy. Sold Together extension enables the display of two cross-sell blocks. **Frequently Bought Together** shows products that were bought in the same order. **Who Bought Also Bought** block is based on implemented orders history. It allows you to display the products which are already trusted by other users.

### Weight

Sold Together extension uses term "weight".

**Weight** is a number that presents relations between Product 1 and Product 2.

In case of "Frequently Bought Together", weight is number of orders, that contains Product 1 and Product 2.

In case of "Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought", weight is number of customers, who bought product 1 and product 2 (in different orders or in one order).

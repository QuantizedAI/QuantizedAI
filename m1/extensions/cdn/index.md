CDN implementation will let your visitors benefit from faster page loads that will lead to increased sales conversions.

So how CDN integration works? Our extension allows you to host and distribute product images, categories images, javascript and CSS files on a separate server. This will improve your page load time by moving multiple files request from your server to content delivery network.

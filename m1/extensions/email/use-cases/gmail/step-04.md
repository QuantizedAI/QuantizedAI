If you get success message then transport works fine and you can check your
inbox at gmail. You will find there email with subject
_"Test Email Transport ..."_. Now you can go to [final step](../step-06/) ▶.

But there is a big possibility you get an error message similar to message on
screenshot below. It means that Magento cannot login to gmail account due to
its security settings. Check next step to find out how to fix it.

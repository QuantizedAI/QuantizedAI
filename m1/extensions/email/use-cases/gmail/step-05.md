# Gmail Setup

### Step 5 - gmail security

If you had an error on previous step, then you have to change security
settings of your gmail account.

Google provides you two options:

 *  Allow access for less secure apps (check
    [this article](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255) if you
    want to enable access for less secure apps)
 *  Sign in using App Passwords

We recommend second option. It is trickier but it does not downgrade your
gmail account security.

Here is article from Google how to
[Sign in using App Passwords](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833). Please, follow its steps to generate new app password. Then take new generated app password...

... and paste it into field `Password` of respective transport.

`✔ Save` transport and test it one more time as it is describe in
[step 4](../step-04/).

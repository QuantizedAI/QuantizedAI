### Step 4 - test transport

When transport successfully saved you can see message above transport grid.

![Step 04.1](/images/m1/extensions/email/use-cases/yahoo/step-04-1.png)

Now you have to test new transport.

Click on a row with new transport in grid or click _Edit_ in `Action` column. This opens _Edit Email Transport_ page. Click button `✔ Test Email Transport`.

![Step 04.2](/images/m1/extensions/email/use-cases/yahoo/step-04-2.png)

If you get success message then transport works fine and you can check your
inbox at gmail. You will find there email with subject
_"Test Email Transport ..."_. Now you can go to [final step](../step-06/) ▶.

In some cases it can take 3-5 minutes.

But there is a big possibility you get an error message similar to message on
screenshot below. As you can understand from message Magento can not login to
your Yahoo accont because of incorrect credentials.

![Step 04.3](/images/m1/extensions/email/use-cases/yahoo/step-04-3.png)

You can double check yahoo login and password, but it also can be caused by
security settings of your account. Go to your yahoo inbox and check if there is
new mail with subject "Sign in attempt prevented".

Go to next step to find out how to fix it.

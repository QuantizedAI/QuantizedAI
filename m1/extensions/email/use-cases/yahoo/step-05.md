# Gmail Setup

### Step 5 - gmail security

If you had an error on previous step, then you have to change security
settings of your gmail account.

Yahoo gives you two options:

 *  Allow apps that use less secure sign in (check
    [this article](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/account/SLN27791.html) if you
    want to enable access for less secure apps)
 *  Enable two-step verification and use App Passwords

We recommend second option. It is trickier but it does not downgrade your
yahoo account security.

Here is article from Yahoo how
[Turn two-step verification on and use app passwords](https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN5013.html). Please, follow its steps to generate new app password. Then take new generated app password...

... and paste it into field `Password` of respective transport.

![Step 05.2](/images/m1/extensions/email/use-cases/yahoo/step-05-2.png)

`✔ Save` transport and test it one more time as it is describe in
[step 4](../step-04/).

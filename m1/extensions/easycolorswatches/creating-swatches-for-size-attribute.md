# Creating swatches for **size** attribute

Please notice, you can apply swatches only to configurable products. Customers can select product attributes as many times as they want to see different variants of product.

Go to `Admin > Templates-Master > Easy Color Swatches > Product Swatches`. 

![Color swatches](/images/m1/extensions/swatches/size-attribute-admin.png)

First put a tick in the `Use Color Swatches` field. Now you can configure swatches with selected attribute (size attribute in current case). Customers can use thumbnails as well as options from drop down list.

**Note**: we recommend you to use text buttons. Also you can use image swatches to display size options.

Swatches can appear individually or in groups. It depends on the availability of the product of this size. Put a tick in the upper fields in order to set the display of swatches as on the product page either on the category page.

In case you allow customers see the size what they selected, in the shopping cart, please put a tick in the upper `Change Checkout Product image`.

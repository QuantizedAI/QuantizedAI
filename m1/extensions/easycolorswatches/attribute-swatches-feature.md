# Attribute swatches feature

![Color swatches](/images/m1/extensions/swatches/attribute-for-each-product.png)

Simplify the workflow with EasyColorSwatches module. Once you apply the attribute to the product, the swatch with specified attribute value will be implemented for each product with this attribute every next time. The attribute swatches interface allows you to use the image, color icon or plain text to show swatches list. Picking up a color is available with a color palette. You can also select the display type of swatches on frontend from the drop down.

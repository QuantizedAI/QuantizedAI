### Top navigation

Top navigation items are more visible and easier to find. As usual, the products there are accompanied by the header and logo - both of which are the most catchy elements on a web page.

### Navigation in left column

The navigation in left column is considered to be better for orientation - a user is able to cover a larger amount of information. It is also easier to perceive left menu, as it is similar to the usual text items separated in a natural way, while the top menu needs additional separators, whether empty space, or something else. We recommend to show left navigation on the homepage.

### Navigation in right column

There are a few pros of the navigation in a right column: it puts a content first visually; it is more common for blogs; the cursor is hovering over near the scrollbars on the right.

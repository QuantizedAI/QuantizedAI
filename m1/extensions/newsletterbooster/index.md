# Newsletter Booster

Our module will help you to [create customer segments](managing-customer-segments/) based on history of customer orders, geographical parameters; [add newsletter campaigns](creating-campaign/) and send them to three separate user type groups based on different subscription source; track your newsletter performance with Google Analytics, verify email addresses before sending newsletter campaings.  

The Newsletter Booster extension consists of two tightly integrated modules - **Segmentation Suite** and **Newsletter Booster**.

Please review the following basic terms before using a module.

`Customer segment` - it is a group of customers who share one or more attributes that are associated with marketing operations.

`Newsletter Booster subscribers` - are users subscribed to the newsletter with Newsletter Boosterâ€™s features implementation.
`Segment Customers` - are users categorised according to the created customer segment.

Usually you don't need to use widgets, because Easy Banners automatically adds
placeholders into referenced blocks. Hovewer widget gives you additional ability
to show the banner directly inside CMS content. So, if you want to insert banners
inside your CMS page content - use widgets.

There are two widgets available to use:

 -  Easybanner banner (easybanner/widget_banner)
 -  Easybanner placeholder (easybanner/widget_placeholder)

### Contents

- [Insert widget with wysiwyg editor](#insert-widget-with-wysiwyg-editor)
- [Using widget at _CMS > Widgets_ page](#using-widget-at-cms--widgets-page)

### Insert widget with wysiwyg editor

Easybanner widgets are available to use for every content field that has a
"Insert Widget" button:

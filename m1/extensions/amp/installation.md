### Unpack Archive

 1. Navigate to _System > Tools > Compilation_ and disable compilation mode.
 2. Go to your magento store root directory via FTP or CPanel.
 3. Create file `maintenance.flag` in root directory.
 4. Open your store in browser; you have to see page
    `Service Temporarily Unavailable` (if you don't see this page - probably
    you are trying to install extension at wrong magento instance).
 5. Unpack all files from extension archive into your magento store root
    directory.
 6. Remove file `maintenance.flag` when copy process completed.
 7. Login your store admin and start to configure extension.

### Run Installer

 1. Navigate to _Templates Master > Modules_, find **TM_Amp** module in the list,
    open `Select` action and click `Open Installer` link.

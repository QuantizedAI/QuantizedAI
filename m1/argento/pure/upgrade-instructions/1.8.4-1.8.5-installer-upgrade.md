## Argento 1.8.4 - 1.8.5 Upgrade Using Installer

To switch to new `homepage` and `footer` please follow the next steps:

1. Delete deprecated footer template:

    ```
    app/design/frontend/argento/pure/template/page/html/footer.phtml
    ```

    Old `footer` block is not used anymore, so you can copy your custom
    content from it into new `footer_cms` block.

2. Reinstall ArgentoPure theme:

    Go to `Templates Master > Modules`, press `Manage` for `TM_ArgentoPure`
    design, select store view where you have theme installed and press `Run`.
    This will create new `homepage` and new static blocks.
    Backups will be created for old blocks and banners.

    If you've made homepage modifications, now you can copy your changes
    from `home_backup` to new `homepage`.

3.  Remove compatibility css:

-   open file

    ```
    app/design/frontend/argento/pure/layout/theme.xml
    ```

    and remove line 8 with code:

    ```xml
    <action method="addItem"><type>skin_css</type><name>css/old-pure.css</name></action>
    ```

-   delete css file `skin/frontend/argento/pure/css/old-pure.css`

#### Brand Logo

Argento use Attributepage module to show the brand logo. So, first you need
to setup the Attributepage extension.

1. Navigate to TemplateMasters > Attribute Pages > Manage Pages and create brands
page based on `manufacturer` attribute. Feel free to use any other attribute.
2. Attach image and thumbnail images to each of the attributepage options.
3. Open `Cms > Static Blocks` and open `product_sidebar` block.
4. Change `manufacturer` to attribute code, that you are using for saved attributepage.

Code:

```html
{% raw %}<div class="block block-product-sidebar">
    <div class="block-content">
        {{block type="attributepages/product_option" template="tm/attributepages/product/options.phtml" width="180" height="90" use_image="1" image_type="image" use_link="1" attribute_code="manufacturer" css_class="hidden-label"}}
        {{block type="cms/block" block_id="services_sidebar"}}
    </div>
</div>{% endraw %}
```

#### Services block

Services sidebar block is a simple cms block powered with FontAwesome icons.

You can edit this block at `Cms > Static Blocks > services_sidebar`.

>  the `product_sidebar` cms block.

Code:

```html
<div class="block block-services-sidebar">
    <div class="block-title"><span>Our Services</span></div>

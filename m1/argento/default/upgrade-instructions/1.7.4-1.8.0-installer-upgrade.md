## Argento 1.7.4 - 1.8.0 Upgrade Using Installer

To switch to new `homepage` and `footer` please follow the next steps:

1. Delete deprecated footer template:

    ```
    app/design/frontend/argento/argento/template/page/html/footer.phtml
    ```

    > Footer now displays two new cms blocks: `footer_toolbar` and `footer_cms`.
    >
    > Old blocks `footer_links`, `footer_contacts` and `footer_social` are
    > not used anymore, so you can copy your custom content from them into new
    > blocks.

2. Reinstall ArgentoArgento theme:

    Go to `Templates Master > Modules`, press `Manage` for `TM_ArgentoArgento`
    design, select store view where you have theme installed and press `Run`.
    This will create new `homepage` and new static blocks.
    Backups will be created for old blocks and banners.

    If you've made homepage modifications, now you can copy your changes
    from `home_backup` to new `homepage`.

3. Update image dimensions

    - Homepage top banners size was changed to 311x110.
    - Slider size was changed to 635x325. You need to upload new images and
        set new `Width` and `Height` in `Templates Master > Easyslide`.

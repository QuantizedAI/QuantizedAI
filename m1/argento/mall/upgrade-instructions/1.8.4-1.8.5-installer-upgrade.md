## Argento 1.8.4 - 1.8.5 Upgrade Using Installer

To switch to new `homepage` and `footer` please follow the next steps:

1. Delete deprecated footer template:

    ```
    app/design/frontend/argento/mall/template/page/html/footer.phtml
    ```

    Old `footer_links` block is not used anymore, so you can copy your custom
    content from it into new `footer_cms` block.

2. Reinstall ArgentoMall theme:

    Go to `Templates Master > Modules`, press `Manage` for `TM_ArgentoMall`
    design, select store view where you have theme installed and press `Run`.
    This will create new `homepage` and new static blocks.
    Backups will be created for old blocks and banners.

    If you've made homepage modifications, now you can copy your changes
    from `home_backup` to new `homepage`.

3.  Remove compatibility css:

    -   open file

        ```
        app/design/frontend/argento/mall/layout/theme.xml
        ```

        and remove line 9 with code:

        ```xml
        <action method="addItem"><type>skin_css</type><name>css/old-mall.css</name></action>
        ```

    -   delete css file `skin/frontend/argento/mall/css/old-mall.css`

4.  Update image dimensions

    -   Homepage top banner width was changed to 225 pixels.

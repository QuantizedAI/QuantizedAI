# Product Page

On the collection page, you can customize the [Header Top bar](/shopify/themes/stripes/header-top-bar), [Header](/shopify/themes/stripes/header) and [Footer](/shopify/themes/stripes/footer).

The main content of Argento Stripes product page consists of **Product information, Product tabs, Product recommendations** and **Icons bar** sections. You can enable/disable each section by visibility badge. You can add a new section and the new blocks in some sections. You can also remove blocks you donâ€™t need.

### Product information

In the Argento theme, there are many settings to edit on the product page. In the product information block, you can enable sticky product information on large screens and the Quick Add option. The **Quick Add** option enables the display of Add to cart button next to the product details block. When users learn more about product details, they would like to add it to the shopping cart without scrolling to the top. The option is a nice solution for a better experience on mobile.

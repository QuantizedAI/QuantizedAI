In this article, we'll describe the process of creating the Argento Stripes Homepage. We'll describe what blocks we used and their configurations.

If you are not familiar with the Shopware Shopping Experiences yet, please check the documentation here: [Shopware 6 Shopping Experiences][shopping_experiences]

Begin with creating a new layout of full-width **Landing Page** at **Content > Shopping Experiences** page: [Creating a New Layout][new_layout]

### Slider

 - Create new **Full Width** section and set **Background Color** to `#d4d8da`.
 - Insert **Image Slider** block from the **Images** category.
 - Upload slider images on the **Content** tab and configure it on the **Settings** tab:

### Top Banners

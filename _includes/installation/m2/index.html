There are several ways to install extension:

 1. If you've bought the product at Magento's Marketplace - use
    [Marketplace installation instructions](marketplace/)
 2. Otherwise, you have two options:
    -   [Install](composer/) and
        [Update](composer-update/) the sources
        directly from our repository - **recommended**.
    -   Or, you can manually download and unpack composer archive and then run
        [Install](manual/) or
        [Update](manual-update/) commands.

## Prepare to install

Installation requires Marketplace module. It’s our module that
registers our packages repository in composer.json file, saves its credentials
to the auth.json file, automates a bunch of complex commands required to run
prior and after module installation, and provides easy to use module installer.

```bash
composer require swissup/module-marketplace &&\
bin/magento setup:upgrade --safe-mode=1 &&\
bin/magento marketplace:channel:enable swissuplabs
```

You'll be asked to activate your domain and enter your key. Get identity key(s)
and activate the domain on the site where you’ve downloaded the product:
{% if include.argentotheme != 'false' %}
 -  [argentotheme.com](https://argentotheme.com/license/customer/activation/){% endif %}{% if include.firecheckout != 'false' %}
 -  [firecheckout.net](https://firecheckout.net/license/customer/activation/){% endif %}{% if include.swissuplabs != 'false' %}
 -  [swissuplabs.com](https://swissuplabs.com/license/customer/activation/){% endif %}

When Marketplace module is installed you can proceed with installation
in teminal:

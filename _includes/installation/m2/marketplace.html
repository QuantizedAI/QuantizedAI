## Prepare to install

Installation requires Marketplace module. Itâ€™s our module that
registers Magento packages repository in composer.json file, saves its credentials
to the auth.json file, automates a bunch of complex commands required to run
prior and after module installation, and provides easy to use module installer.

```bash
composer require swissup/module-marketplace &&\
bin/magento setup:upgrade --safe-mode=1 &&\
bin/magento marketplace:channel:enable magento
```

You'll be asked to enter your credentials. Get your credentials at
[marketplace.magento.com](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/)

## Install

When Marketplace module is installed you can proceed with installation
in teminal:

```bash
composer require {{ include.package }} &&\
bin/magento setup:upgrade --safe-mode=1 &&\
bin/magento setup:di:compile &&\
bin/magento setup:static-content:deploy{% if include.installer == 'true' %} &&\
bin/magento marketplace:package:install {{ include.package }}{% endif %}
```

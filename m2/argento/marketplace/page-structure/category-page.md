### Content
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

Category page in Argento Marketplace has traditional elements of Magento 2 category page:

  - category title;
  - layered navigation (when category is anchored) or list of child categories (non-anchored category);
  - product list with toolbar and pagination.

### Layout

Argento Marketplace uses `2columns-left` layout for the category page. Follow our [customization guide](/m2/argento/customization/change-page-layout/)
to change it to another one. Or use [category page builder](/m2/argento/customization/theme-editor/#category-page-builder) in theme editor.

### Product list

![List item example](/images/m2/argento/marketplace/category/product-list-hover.png)

We recommend to use grid mode for product list. Since it is the most popular products presentation among ecommerce.

Product list is powered by [Hover Gallery](/m2/extensions/hover-gallery/configuration/) module. It changes image when user is hovering over product image. Check module docs for more details.

One more feature at product listing is product labels - "NEW", "-5%" etc. It is provided by [ProLabels](/m2/extensions/prolabels/) module.

### Add to cart popup

![Ajaxpro popup](/images/m2/argento/marketplace/category/ajaxpro-popup.png)

Magento shows add to cart popup when user adds product to cart from product list. And when this product has some options to select.

This popup is implemented by [Ajax Pro](/m2/extensions/ajaxpro/) module.

### Recently viewed

One distinct feature of Argento themes is Recently Viewed block at category page. This block shows recently viewed products by current visitor on current device/PC.
For Argento Marketplace this block is under the product listing.

# Product Page
{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

### Layout

Argento Force uses `1column` layout for the product page. Follow our [customization guide](/m2/argento/customization/change-page-layout/)
to change it to another one.

### Add to Cart Form

![Add to cart form](/images/m2/argento/force/product/add-form.png)

Main part of product page is "add to cart" form. It is on the top of the page  in Argento Force. "Add to cart" consists of product images gallery (left side) and form itself (right side).

Product images gallery is powered by [Lightbox Pro](/m2/extensions/lightboxpro/) module. This module allows you to change thumbnails position and size, enable zoom and change image popup type.

For add to cart form we recommend:

 -  for product **"Size"** attribute set *"Catalog Input Type for Store Owner"* as **Dropdown**;
 -  for product **"Color"** attribute set *"Catalog Input Type for Store Owner"* as **Visual Swatch** and *"Use Product Image for Swatch if Possible"* as **Yes**.

#### Sizing Chart

![Sizing Chart](/images/m2/argento/force/product/sizing-chart.png)

Please pay close attention to screenshot in "Add to Cart Form" paragraph. There is link "View Sizing Chart". It opens sizing chart popup.

"View Sizing Chart" link appears near size otion at every product page. It is added via CMS Block.

Block identifier is `sizing_chart`. If you want to disable sizing char then simple disable CMS Block via Magento Admin.

If you need to modifiy content of the popup then modify content inside `<div data-role="sizing-chart" ...>...</div>`. Remember to disable WYSIWYG editor before everything. All the magic happens at the bottom of content with JavaScript. You can rename link or add it in other place their. It requires basic JavaScript knowledge. Or you can conatct our support ad they will be glad to help you.

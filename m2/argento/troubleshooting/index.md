# Troubleshooting

### Argento "Can't generate content" at Magento 2.2 homepage

**Magento 2.2** version is not using that widget part anymore:

```
conditions_encoded="a:1:[i:1;a:4:[s:4:`type`;s:50:`Magento|CatalogWidget|Model|
Rule|Condition|Combine`;s:10:`aggregator`;s:3:`all`;s:5:`value`;s:1:`1`;
s:9:`new_child`;s:0:``;]]"
```

but it is included in installation for earlier versions support.

**Fixing**

 1. Open your homepage content and turn off **WYSIWYG** editor to see the raw code
 2. Find all **Highlight** widgets
 3. Remove that part ```conditions_encoded="a:1:[i:1;a:4....;]]"``` from every widget
 4. Save. Enjoy!

### Getting error: Required parameter 'theme_dir' was not passed

Such errors can happen if you have __"virtual"__ themes instead of __"normal"__.
That sometimes happens during the upgrade.

**Fixing**

* Go to `PhpMyAdmin` > `Your Magento2 database`
* Find the `"theme"` table
* And make sure that all theme types are set to `'0'`
* In case any of them have `type` = `'1'` change it to `'0'`
* Error should be gone

### Troubleshooting Checklist

> Often the problems are not related to `Swissup` themes or modules.
> But it takes much time to get your **credentials**, **login** to server, find
> out the problem **solution**.


Before developers check your problem we recommend you to run through the following
list points. It will **save** your time and make the support **faster and effective**:

- Check if you have the latest **Argento** version.
     * `Admin > Swissup > Module Management` - modules' versions should be 'GREEN'
     * Please [UPGRADE](/m2/argento/installation/#upgrade-instructions) when required.

     > **Clear cache** and test if the error still there

- Swith your current **Argento** theme design to Magento default **LUMA**

     * `Admin > Content > Configuration > Find your theme > Edit` > Set **Magento Luma**

     * <video controls width="800">
            <source src="https://webm.red/YddF.webm"
                    type="video/webm">
            Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
        </video>

     > **Clear cache** and test the behavior at default theme

- **Disable** all **Swissup** modules (run following terminal command from your store root folder)

    ```bash
    bin/magento module:status | grep 'Swissup_' | xargs bin/magento module:disable
    ```

    > **Clear cache** and test if the error still there

- **Disable** all 3rd-party modules

    > **Clear cache** and test if the error still there

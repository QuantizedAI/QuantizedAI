# Easy Slider

If you're running the web-store and want to see it successful, you have to make store pages eye-catching. In order to grab visitors' attention to web-pages, we recommend to use slider with advertising. Therefore we offer you to check our Easy Slider extension.
The extension will help to easily create an unlimited number of professional looking image sliders and improve overall look of your store just in 1 minute. Using the module, you will be able to display image slides with title and short description.

You can create sliders not only from images but from any HTML content (available since module version 1.8.0). Use youtube videos, SVG images or anything you want with raw html slides.

Also you can place your slider at any place of your store as magento widget.

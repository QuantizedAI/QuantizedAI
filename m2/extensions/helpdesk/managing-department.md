# Managing department

The following settings allow you to distribute different types of requests between various groups of support administrators. The use of different departments saves time and makes the support process more efficient. In order to use our extension, you have to create at least one active department.

Also you can create multiple departments and direct support tickets to them. In order to create a new department go `Admin > Swissup > Helpdesk > Departments` and click on **Add New Department**.

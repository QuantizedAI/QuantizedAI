# Compatibility

ReCapthca extension compatible with all Magento core extensions. It is available
for every form that supports Magento Captcha.

In most cases our recaptcha works "out of box" with any payment at checkout. As
well as with most popular third-party checkout solutions - FireCheckout, Amasty
One Step Checkout, Mageplaza One Step Checkout, etc.

Exceptions may be some rare payments or extensions that add custom fields to
checkout (e.g., order comment). But we do our best to solve all issues. Just
contact our support team.

Some times solving compatibility issue requires additional tweaks. And we can't
include them in our recaptcha extension for one reason or an other. We offer
free integration extensions in such cases. You can check list of them below.

 -  **Meetanshi_Paya** - integration of USA payment gateway in Magento 2 from
    vendor Meetanshi requires [`module-recaptcha-meetanshi-paya`](https://github.com/swissup/module-recaptcha-meetanshi-paya);
 -  **Sezzle_Sezzlepay** - integration of 'buy now and pay later' platform in
    Magento 2 requires [`module-recaptcha-sezzlepay`](https://github.com/swissup/module-recaptcha-sezzlepay);

    Magento 2 from Elavon themselves requires

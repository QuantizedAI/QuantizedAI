### Captcha at checkout

![ReCAPTCHA at checkout](/images/m2/recaptcha/recaptcha-checkout-example.gif)

You can protect your store checkout by adding recaptcha to its final step. Recaptcha appears in payment section. Just go to module [configuration](../configuration/), select option and clear Magento config cache.

It is possible to show recaptcha for guest as well as for signed-in users. But we recommend to show recaptcha only for guests. Try to keep checkout process for signed-in user as simple and quick as possible.

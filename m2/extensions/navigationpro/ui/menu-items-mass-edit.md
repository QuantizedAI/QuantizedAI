# Mass Edit Popup

> Added since 1.12.0

When setting up a bit complex menu structure it turns out that a way to many
menu items needs the same settings but you can't use
global or per-level settings because they are already used by a bunch of another
items.

Mass edit popup comes to rescue! You can find it by clicking the **Mass Edit**
button above [items tree](/m2/extensions/navigationpro/ui/menu-items-tree/).
It's a simple one-page form that allows to modify almost all item settings for
unlimited number of items in a moment:

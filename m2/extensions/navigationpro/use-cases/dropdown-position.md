# Manual Dropdown Position

> Don't have a menu yet? Create [simple menu][simple-menu] and come back!

Sometimes you need to change dropdown position for particular dropdown only.
Here is a short instruction on how to do that:

 1. Navigate to _Swissup > NavigationPro_ page, open menu to edit.
 2. Click on the parent item of the dropdown you wish to change.
 3. Add one of the following css classes into the
    [CSS Class field](/m2/extensions/navigationpro/backend/menu-edit/#advanced-settings):

    -  navpro-stick-left
    -  navpro-stick-right
    -  navpro-stick-center

> If you want to change position for all First Level Dropdown items, please use
> [Dropdown Position setting](/m2/extensions/navigationpro/ui/dropdown-position/).

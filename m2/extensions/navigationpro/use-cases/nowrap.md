when there is not enough space to fit on a single row.

Nowrap feature automatically hides last menu items to guarantee that menu will
fit on a single row.

To activate nowrap feature, you need to add `navpro-nowrap` class to the
[CSS Class field](/m2/extensions/navigationpro/backend/menu-settings/#general-settings).

### Offset feature

> This feature available since 1.11.0

Offset feature should be used when menu doesn't takes all amount of width in
parent container. The best way to explain this feature - is to show an example.

Let's imagine the following header:

In the example above, menu is placed between logo and
cart/search icons (100px width). To activate nowrap feature for this
header type, you need to:

 -  Add `navpro-nowrap` class to the
    [CSS Class field](/m2/extensions/navigationpro/backend/menu-settings/#general-settings)
 -  Add `navpro-nowrap-offset-100` class to the
    [CSS Class field](/m2/extensions/navigationpro/backend/menu-settings/#general-settings)

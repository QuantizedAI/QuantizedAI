# SEO Canonical URL

Absolutely gorgeous module that adds canonical URLs for products, categories and CMS pages in Magento 2.

One of the best features use parent product url as canonical for child. If product is included in configurable, bundle or grouped product then you can force it to use parent product url as its canonical. This feature can be useful for stores with really big catalog of products when store owner want to consolidate Google indexing.

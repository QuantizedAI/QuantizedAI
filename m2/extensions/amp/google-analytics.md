# Google Analytics

AMP is using Magento's Google Analytics functionality. So, if you are using
_Stores > Configuration > Sales > Google API > Google Analytics_ on your
desktop site, our AMP module will add the script automatically.

Otherwise, you need to navigate to Magento Google Analytics configuration to
enable it and fill your "Account Number":

> "Anonymize IP" and "Enable Content Experiments" options are not used by AMP.

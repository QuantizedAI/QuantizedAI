# Abandoned Cart

Abandoned shopping cart doesn’t mean “lost sales”. Using the Abandonment Cart
module you will create reminders both for registered customers and guests.
The extension comes with 3 pre-written email templates, extended email settings,
flexible rules for sending well-timed email reminders and history interface.

# Customer Field Manager

Customer Field Manager allows to:
 -  change customer form fields status, sort order, default values and labels
 -  create new customer fields

Custom customer fields can be displayed on:

 -  Frontend:
    -  customer registration page
    -  edit customer information page
 -  Backend:
    -  edit customer form
    -  create new order form

Works great with standard magento checkout and
[Firecheckout](/m2/extensions/firecheckout/) modules.

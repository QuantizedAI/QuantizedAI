# Address Field Manager

Address Field Manager allows to:
 -  change address form fields status, sort order, default values and labels
 -  create new address fields

Custom address fields are automatically displayed on:

 -  Frontend:
    -  checkout billing and shipping address forms
    -  create and edit address forms in customer account
 -  Backend:
    -  edit customer form
    -  edit billing and shipping address on order view page
    -  create new order form
 - API:
    - list of orders using `orders` endpoint
    - order information using `orders/{id}` endpoint

Works great with standard magento checkout and
[Firecheckout](/m2/extensions/firecheckout/) modules.

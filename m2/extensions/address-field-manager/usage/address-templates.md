# Address Templates

To display custom address fields in billing and shipping addresses that appear
on printed invoices, shipments, refunds and in the address book of the
customer account, you need to add field to address templates under
_"Stores > Configuration > Customers > Customer Configuration > Address Templates."_

Please check Magento 2 manual for

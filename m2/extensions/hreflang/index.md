# Regional and Language URLs

![rel="alternate" hreflang](/images/m2/hreflang/example.png){:class="noborder"}

First thing you have to know, this module does not add any visible enhancements at your storefront. Its goal is to improve targeting of site content to a specific country. And second, you get any benefits from this module only when your store is multilingual and/or multi-regional.

Regional URLs module helps you to tell search engines (e.g. Google) that you have multiple versions of a page for different languages or regions. And search engine point users to the most appropriate version of your page by language or region.

You can also add locale as subdirectory into store base url with this modules.

We generate correct and valid URLs for every store view your Magento has. There are no redirects with this URLs and no 404 pages. Search bots gonna love them.

Module has simple and pretty self-explanatory settings. But in case you need some info you can find it here - [module configuration](configuration/).

Extension works perfectly with:

 -  Home page and CMS Pages;
 -  Category Pages (with and without layered navigation filters);
 -  Product Pages.

> Regional URLs modules is a part of [SEO Suite](../seo-suite/) toolkit. And we do not provide it as independent Magento 2 extension.

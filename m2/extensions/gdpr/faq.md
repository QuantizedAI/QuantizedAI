### How can I export my data?

This feature is not supported yet.

### What happens when client's data get's deleted?

For now we do not actually delete the data. All personal data is being anonymized
instead. Here is the list of anonymized data:

 -  Customer Data
 -  Customer Addresses
 -  Shopping Cart Data
 -  Sales Orders
 -  Sales Addresses
 -  Invoices
 -  Shipments
 -  Payments
 -  Creditmemos
 -  Newsletter Subscribers (This data is deleted, since we don't need fake emails in our newsletter.)
 -  Product Reviews
 -  GDPR Data (Consents and Request are anonymyzed too)

### How to inform existing customers about changes in Privacy Policy?

You need to create an email newsletter campaign using MailChimp or other
preferrable solution with the text that informs customers about changes in your
privacy policy.

Our module has a [Privacy Tools](/m2/extensions/gdpr/privacy-tools/) page that
informs customers about given consents.

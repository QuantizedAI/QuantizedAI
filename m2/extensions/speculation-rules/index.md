# Speculation Rules

### Description

Speculation rules take the form of a JSON structure that determines what resources should be prefetched or prerendered by the browser. This is part of the [Speculation Rules API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API)

The [Speculation Rules API](https://github.com/WICG/nav-speculation/blob/main/triggers.md#speculation-rules) is a JSON-defined API developed by Google to enhance the performance of web page loading through speculative loading strategies.
One more [description](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Speculation_Rules_API) by Mozilla MDN.

### How Does It Work?
Google's Speculation Rules API is designed to target document URLs rather than specific resource files. The Speculation Rules API introduces a more expressive and configurable syntax for specifying which documents should be prefetched or prerendered.
With a structure defined in JSON format within a script `type="speculationrules"`, developers can articulate rules for both prerendering and prefetching. This enhanced flexibility allows for fine-tuning speculative loading.

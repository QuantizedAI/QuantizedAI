Option *"Links with 'nofollow' in Layered Navigation"* adds HTML attribute `rel` with value "nofollow" to all filter values of current attribute in Layered Navigation.

This optoin works great with [Swissup Ajax Layered Navigation](/m2/extensions/ajaxlayerednavigation/) as well as with default Magento Layered Navigation.

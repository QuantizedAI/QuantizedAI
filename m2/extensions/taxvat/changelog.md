### Version 1.4.0

> Dec 17, 2020

This release fixes validation at multishipping checkout. However, because of bug in
Magento, you can't create an account during multishipping checkout. If you use it and
allow customers to register during multishipping checkout you must apply the following patches:

 - [31321](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/31321) - will add "VAT Number"
field to the customer registration page.
 - [31318](https://github.com/magento/magento2/pull/31318) - will fix error during
registration if entered Vat Number is invalid.

**Changes**

 -  **Magento 2.2.x and older are not supported anymore** because of updated
    taxvat validation logic. We started using built-in
    `Magento\Customer\Model\Address\CompositeValidator` to validate taxvat.
 -  Fixed ability to place order with empty "Tax Number" field despite of
    [config value](/m2/extensions/taxvat/configuration/#general-section)
    when using multishipping checkout.

## Known Issues

##### Shipping method depends from totals on default checkout

When you have shipping method which has `Minimum Order Amount` set in config,
you can face following problem on default checkout:

 -  you add few products to cart and totals amount is greater
 than configured `Minimum Order Amount`
 -  on checkout `Shipping` step you select shipping method
 -  on checkout `Payment` step you decrease quantity and order amount
 becomes smaller than configured `Minimum Order Amount`
 -  shipping method selected on `Shipping` step becomes unavailable
 and you can't place order

This issue only happens on default Magento 2 checkout.
There is no such problem with [Firecheckout](../firecheckout).

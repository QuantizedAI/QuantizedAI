# Apply Email Design
{:.no_toc}

Module provides an easy way to apply design for all emails.

We extended core Magento interface with email designs dropdown.

Go to _Magento Admin_ ⇨ _Content_ ⇨ _Design Configuration_. Select scope you need. Open section **Transactional Emails**.

We offer 5 designs:

 -  Simple Blue;
 -  Argento Force;
 -  Argento Home;
 -  Argento Luxury;
 -  Argento Stripes.

Argento designs inspired by our [Argento theme](/m2/argento/).

Select one of designs and click “Save” button. All default email templates will be replaced with templates from selected design. Default template is email template provided by respective moduel itself (and NOT customized via Magento Admin).

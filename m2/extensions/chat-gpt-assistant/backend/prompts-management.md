#### Available Directives

**{% raw %}{{attribute code="..." [prefix="..."] [sufix="..."] [exclude="..."]}}{% endraw %}** - value of attribute by its code. You can set multiple codes separated with comma or use "*" for all attributes. With configurable product this directive can return values of attribute from child products. The `exclude` option allows you to exclude some values from output. It can contain multiple values separated with comma.

*Example:*

```
product attributes: {% raw %}{{attribute code="*"}}{% endraw %}
```

*Result:*

```
product attributes: Activity: Yoga, Hiking, School. Style Bags: Backpack, Laptop. Material: Burlap, Nylon, Polyester. Strap/Handle: Adjustable, Double, Padded. Features: Hydration Pocket, Audio Pocket, Waterproof, Lightweight.
```

**{% raw %}{{categories [depth="N"] [prefix="..."] [sufix="..."]}}{% endraw %}** - category product is assigned for. When product assigned to multiple categories all of them outputed. You can set how deep of category tree goes: if depth=1 then directive returns only direct parents, if depth=2 - direct parents and parents of those parents, and so on. You can use options prefix, suffix, and exclude also.

*Example:*

```
product categories: {% raw %}{{categories}}{% endraw %}
```

*Result:*

```
product categories: Bags, Gear
```

**{% raw %}{{langCode}}{% endraw %}** - language code on the current scope. Use it to instruct the model on which language to use in content generation.

*Example:*

```
Create short product description for {% raw %}{{attribute code="name"}}{% endraw %} in {% raw %}{{langCode}}{% endraw %} language.
```

*Result:*

```
Create short product description for Fusion Backpack in en_US language.
```

**{% raw %}{{subcats [prefix="..."] [sufix="..."] [exclude="..."] [limit="..."] [separator="..."]}}{% endraw %}** - get subcategories for category. You can set max number of subcategories to output (limit) and separator (separator). With exclude option you can exclude some subcategories from output by their names.

*Example:*

```
Write a short marketing description for the product category "{% raw %}{{attribute code="name"}}{% endraw %}" with child subcategories: {% raw %}{{subcats}}{% endraw %}
```

*Result:*

```
Write a short marketing description for the product category "Women" with child subcategories: Tops, Bottoms

With sufix and prefix options you can add some text before or after output. Works only when output is not empty.

Directive options in square brackets ([...]) are optional. If you want to use option please do not wrap it in square brackets.

# Borderless Lightbox

All popup banners have paddings around content.

If you want to remove it, add `no-border` class to the "Css Class"
field in the [banner edit form](/m2/extensions/easybanners/interfaces/#content-tab)
and save the banner.

See [Newsletter Popup](/m2/extensions/easybanners/use-cases/newsletter-popup/)
as an example.

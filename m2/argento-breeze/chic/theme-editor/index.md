### Layout

Layout section allows you to apply [boxed, full-width or standard page layouts](/m2/argento/customization/boxed-full-width-and-standard-layout-types/) from backend settings.

***Body background*** subsection name speaks for itself. Here you specify body background for page. *Remember*: body's background is covered by page wrapper and it's not visible. You need to limit max-width for ***Page wrapper*** to be able to see body background.

With ***Content wrapper*** subsection you can limit width of page content.

Take at look at the picture below with highlighted layout regions:
